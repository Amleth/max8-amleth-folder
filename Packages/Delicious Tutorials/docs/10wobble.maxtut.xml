<h1>Wobble Bass</h1>

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qrk2hE__s">Watch on YouTube</a></h2>

<h2>Commentary</h2>
<p>Full disclosure: when I made this tutorial I was listening to a lot of Skrillex. It was a very manic time in my life; with my programmer roommate I'd often come home from work, crack open my laptop, drink a couple of cups of coffee and start Going in for the Kill, if you get me. Anyway, I wasn't the only one who was riding the dubstep submarine then, it seemed like you could hardly walk two blocks down Valencia street without hearing a drop or two. So, I decided to do a tutorial to figure out what all the fuss was about.</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>
<p>In this video there's a subpatcher called [p noteparse]. I myself do not know what's in there. Maybe no one does. It's a bit of a problem, because it means that no one who watches the video can actually reproduce the patch themselves. Fortunately, what it did was pretty simple, as it's another example of where I could have saved myself a lot of trouble by using the voice management objects like <o>borax</o>, <o>poly</o> and ddg.mono. In any case, see the patch attached to this document for a more up-to-date solution.</p>
