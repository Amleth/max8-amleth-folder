<h2>Commentary</h2>
<p>If you loop something long enough, it's going to start to sound like music. If you'd like to verify this statement for yourself, why not build a boomerang pedal simulator? The key that makes this patch work is right at the left inlet of the poke~ object, where live audio from the microphone is mixed with previously recorded audio (In Max, two audio signals connected to the same inlet are added implicitly).</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>
<p>If you watch the YouTube video carefully, you're going to notice some differences between the patch I build there and the patch attached to this document. In the video I make clicks using a togedge object, but I found a better way to make clicks using a delta~ object instead. More importantly, the video uses a play~ object to read audio, but the updated patch uses an index~. That's a subtle but important difference. Using counter~ and index~ to read back from a buffer usually has the disadvantage that you can't change speed like you can with play~ or groove~. But here, we don't need to change speed, and reading the buffer back using index~ instead of play~ means no interpolation, which is actually important in situations like this where we're writing to a buffer as we're reading it.</p>
