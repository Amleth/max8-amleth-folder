## About

"Gen CV Tools" is a collection of gen patches focused on generating different kinds of control voltage (CV) signals that can be used to control analog / modular synthesizers as well as other Max patches (check the Overview patch for examples).

## How to Use

The easiest way to get started with the gen patches provided in this package is to use the included snippets. 
Simply drag the snippet into your Max patch and route it's output to one of your audio interface's output via the DAC~ object to control analog synthesizers (only compatible with DC-coupled audio interfaces) or route it to other Max objects to control other parts of your patch.
